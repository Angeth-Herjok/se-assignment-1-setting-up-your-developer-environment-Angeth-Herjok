# Dev_Setup
Setup Development Environment

#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

#Tasks:

1. Select Your Operating System (OS):
   Choose an operating system that best suits your preferences and project requirements. Download and Install Windows 11. https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11

2. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
   Select and install a text editor or IDE suitable for your programming languages and workflow. Download and Install Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
3. Set Up Version Control System:
   Install Git and configure it on your local machine. Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories. Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit. https://github.com

4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.

5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).

6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html

7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.

9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process. 

#Deliverables:
- Document detailing the setup process with step-by-step instructions and screenshots where necessary.
- A GitHub repository containing a sample project initialized with Git and any necessary configuration files (e.g., .gitignore).
- A reflection on the challenges faced during setup and strategies employed to overcome them.

#Submission:
Submit your document and GitHub repository link through the designated platform or email to the instructor by the specified deadline.

#Evaluation Criteria:**
- Completeness and accuracy of setup documentation.
- Effectiveness of version control implementation.
- Appropriateness of tools selected for the project requirements.
- Clarity of reflection on challenges and solutions encountered.
- Adherence to submission guidelines and deadlines.

Note: Feel free to reach out for clarification or assistance with any aspect of the assignment.


DOCUMENTATION:


Developer Environment Setup Documentation
Overview
This document outlines the steps I have taken to set up my development environment for the project. The environment includes the necessary tools and configurations to ensure a consistent and efficient workflow.

Operating System
I have installed Windows 11 on my development machine. The Windows 11 installation process was straightforward, and I followed the on-screen instructions provided by the Microsoft download page.

Text Editor/IDE
I have chosen to use Visual Studio Code as my primary text editor and Integrated Development Environment (IDE). I downloaded the latest version of Visual Studio Code from the official website and installed it on my machine. Visual Studio Code provides a rich set of features and extensions that enhance the development experience.

Version Control
For version control, I have set up a GitHub repository for the project. I created a new account on GitHub and initialized a Git repository for the project. This allows me to track changes, collaborate with team members, and manage the codebase effectively.

Programming Language and Runtime
Python is the primary programming language for this project. I have downloaded and installed the latest version of Python from the official website. I have also verified that the Python installation was successful by running python --version in the command prompt.

Package Manager
Python comes with the pip package manager pre-installed. I have confirmed the installation by running pip --version in the command prompt.

Database Configuration
I have installed the MySQL database for the project. I downloaded the latest version of the MySQL Installer for Windows from the official website and followed the on-screen instructions to complete the installation and configuration.

Development Environment Virtualization (Optional)
To ensure a consistent and isolated development environment, I have decided to use Docker containers. I have installed Docker Desktop on my machine and set up the necessary Docker configurations for the project.

Visual Studio Code Extensions and Plugins
To enhance my development workflow in Visual Studio Code, I have installed the following extensions:

Git integration (e.g., GitLens, Git Blame)
Syntax highlighting for Python
Code formatting (e.g., Black, Prettier)
Linting (e.g., pylint, flake8)
These extensions provide additional features and tools to streamline the development process.

Documentation and Reflection
I have created this documentation file to record the steps taken during the setup process. This document serves as a reference for future setup or troubleshooting, and it can also be shared with team members or new developers joining the project.

During the setup process, I encountered a few minor challenges, such as:

Configuring the MySQL database connection in the project code.
Integrating the Docker container with the development environment.
I was able to resolve these issues by referring to the official documentation and seeking guidance from online resources and forums. The experience has helped me better understand the setup requirements and the importance of thorough documentation.
